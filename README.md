This repository compiles the work undertaken towards recording and classifying in a systematic way all the feedback received for GTPB courses, including:
- [x] The creation of an SQL database for recording course information and feedback.
- [x] The automatic population of this database with course information from the GTPB course webpages.
- [x] The development of a [classification system](https://github.com/GTPB/Training_Course_Feedback/tree/master/Maps) for organizing course feedback and tagging participants' comments.
- [x] The digitalization of course feedback collected on paper forms from courses of 2013-2017, including the tagging of comments according to the classification system developed.
- [x] The creation of a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z3XsVXqkGqQfd8m7ScbSw83B9cBCdpQ5nqQVqzkycd4/edit?usp=sharing) for course participants, in Google forms, for courses from 2018 onwards.
- [ ] The population of the database with the feedback collected both on paper and via Google forms.
- [ ] The formalization of the classification system in OWL.
- [ ] The development of a user interface supporting the database and enabling the querying of user feedback data.
