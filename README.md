This repository compiles work in progress that aims at recording and classifying the post-event feedback from GTPB courses in a systematic way. It includes:
- [x] The creation of an SQL database for recording course information and feedback.
- [x] The automatic population of this database with course information from the GTPB course webpages.
- [x] The development of a [classification system](https://github.com/GTPB/Training_Course_Feedback/tree/master/MindMaps) for organizing course feedback and tagging participants' comments.
- [x] The digitalization of course feedback collected on paper forms from courses of 2008-2017, including the tagging of comments using the classification system that has been developed.
- [x] The creation of a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z3XsVXqkGqQfd8m7ScbSw83B9cBCdpQ5nqQVqzkycd4/edit?usp=sharing) for course participants, in Google forms, for courses from 2018 onwards.
- [ ] The population of the database with the feedback collected both on paper and via Google forms.
- [ ] The formalization of the classification system in OWL.
- [ ] The development of a user interface supporting the database and enabling the querying of user feedback data.
